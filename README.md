# Sleepyband

Sleepyband is a tool to capture data logs from the WatchPat-One disposable
sleep study device.

Sleepyband is not affiliated with WatchPat-One or Itamar Medical in any way,
shape, or form.  WatchPat-One (or however they do their trade dress) and Itamar
and probably some other stuff is trademark Itamar Medical.

Sleepyband is not a medical device, nor should it be used in any sort of
medical setting.  This is entirely for people who want to look at their own
data of themselves sleeping.

Sleepyband is also pretty minimalist, and only supports the things I need it
to.  PRs are welcome, but bear in mind that I don't intend to offer all that
much support for this.
